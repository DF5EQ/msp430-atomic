## From original notes, adapted to MSP430
                                                                          
The macros in this header file deal with code blocks that are guaranteed to be excuted atomically or non-atmomically. The term "atomic" in this context refers to the unability of the respective code to be interrupted.

These macros operate via automatic manipulation of the General Interrupt Enable (GIE) bit of the SR register. Exit paths from both block types are all managed automatically without the need for special considerations, i. e. the interrupt status will be restored to the same   value it has been when entering the respective block.

A typical example that requires atomic access is a 32 (or more) bit variable that is shared between the main execution path and an ISR. While declaring such a variable as volatile ensures that the compiler will not optimize accesses to it away, it does not guarantee atomic access to it. Assuming the following example:

    volatile uint32_t ctr;

    ISR()
    {
        ctr--;
    }

    ...
    int main(void)
    {
        ...
        ctr = 0x00020000;
        start_timer();
        __eint();
        while (ctr != 0)
            // wait                                                           
            ;                                                               
        ...
    }
                                                                          
There is a chance where the main context will exit its wait loop when the variable ctr just reached the value 0x0000FFFF.  This happens because the compiler cannot natively access a 32-bit variable atomically in an 16-bit CPU. So the variable is for example at 0x00010000, the compiler then tests the low word for 0, which succeeds. It then proceeds to test the high word, but that moment the ISR triggers, and the main context is interrupted. The ISR will decrement the variable from 0x00010000 to 0x0000FFFF, and the main context proceeds. It now tests the high word of the variable which is (now) also 0, so it concludes the variable has reached 0, and terminates the loop.
 
Using the macros, the above code can be rewritten: 
                                                                          
    #include "atomic.h"

    volatile uint32_t ctr;

    ISR()
    {
        ctr--;
    }

    ...
    int main(void)
    {
        ...
       ctr = 0x00020000;
        start_timer();
        __eint();
        uint32_t ctr_copy;
        do
        {
            ATOMIC_BLOCK_FORCEON                                                 
            (
                ctr_copy = ctr;
            )
        }
        while (ctr_copy != 0);
        ...
    }

This will install the appropriate interrupt protection before accessing variable ctr, so it is guaranteed to be consistently tested. If the global interrupt state were uncertain before entering the ATOMIC BLOCK, ATOMIC_BLOCK_RESTORESTATE should be used rather than ATOMIC_BLOCK_FORCEON.

## Provided example

The provided example in main() is modified contrary to the above discussed example to show the running interrupt and the consequences of blocking/non-blocking with LEDs.

The blocking/non-blocking parts can be activated/deactivated with #if 1 / #if 0
